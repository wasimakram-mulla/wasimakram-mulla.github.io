	<h4><strong>10 Reasons Why You Should Use AngularJS</strong></h4>
	<ul class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>1. MVC done right</strong> <br /> Most frameworks implement MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then require you to write code to string them up together again. That’s a lot of work. Angular implements MVC by asking you to split your app into MVC components, then just let Angular do the rest. Angular manages your components for you and also serves as the pipeline that connects them.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. A declarative user interface. </strong><br/> HTML is also used to determine the execution of the app. Special attributes in the HTML determine which controllers to use for each element. These attributes determine “what” gets loaded, but not “how”. This declarative approach greatly simplifies app development in a sort of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) way. Rather than spending time on how the program flows and what should get loaded first, you simply define what you want and Angular will take care of the dependencies.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Data models are POJO </strong><br/> Data models in Angular are plain old JavaScript objects (POJO) and don’t require extraneous getter and setter functions. You can add and change properties directly on it and loop over objects and arrays at will. Your code will look much cleaner and more intuitive, the way mother nature intended.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Behavior with directives </strong><br/>Directives are Angular’s way of bringing additional functionality to HTML. Imagine a world where HTML has so many rich elements (for example &#60;accordion&#62;&#60;/accordion&#62;, &#60;grid&#62;&#60;/grid&#62;, &#60;lightbox&#62;&#60;/lightbox&#62;, etc.) that we never have to manipulate the DOM to simulate them. All that our app needs to do is to assign attributes to elements to get any functionality out of the box.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>5. Flexibility with filters </strong><br/>Filters are so resourceful that it is possible to create a sortable HTML table using only filters without writing any JavaScript.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>6. Write less code </strong><br/>All the points up till now mean that you get to write less code. You don’t have to write your own MVC pipeline. The view is defined using HTML, which is more concise. Data models are simpler to write without getters/setters. Data-binding means you don’t have to put data into the view manually. Since directives are separate from app code, they can be written by another team in parallel with minimal integration issues. Filters allow you to manipulate data on the view level without changing your controllers.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>7. DOM manipulations where they belong </strong><br/>With Angular, DOM manipulation code should be inside directives and not in the view. Angular sees the view as just another HTML page with placeholders for data. This way of looking at the view pairs nicely with user interface designers.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>8. Service providers where they belong </strong><br/>Controllers are simple, then where should all the heavy lifting be performed? Angular introduces Services to do just that. <br/>Services are exactly what they sound like. They don’t get involved with the MVC of your app, but simply provide an outward API to expose whatever you want it to expose. Most of the time it syncs up to a server to maintain an offline data store and exposes methods to push and pull data to and from a server. Or it can be used to create a resource sharing service that allows multiple controllers to share the same resources.</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>9. Context aware communication </strong><br/> Esp. Two way Data-binding</li>		
		<li class="list-group-item"><strong>10. Unit testing ready </strong><br/>What description of Angular would be complete without talking about it’s unit testing readiness? The whole of Angular is linked together by Dependency Injection (DI). It’s what it uses to manage your controllers and scopes. Because all your controllers depend on DI to pass it information, Angular’s unit tests are able to usurp DI to perform unit testing by injecting mock data into your controller and measuring the output and behavior.</li>
